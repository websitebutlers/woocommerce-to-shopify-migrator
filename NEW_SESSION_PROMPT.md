I need help implementing new migration features for my WooCommerce ↔ Shopify migration tool.

**Context:**
- This is a Next.js 15 (App Router) + React + TypeScript project
- Uses Shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS
- Already has working migrations for: Products, Customers, Orders (view-only), Collections
- Infrastructure is COMPLETE (types, store, API clients all ready)

**What's Ready:**
- ✅ All type definitions added (`src/lib/types.ts`)
- ✅ Store state management updated (`src/lib/store.ts`)
- ✅ WooCommerce API client methods added (`src/lib/woocommerce/client.ts`)
- ✅ Shopify API client methods added (`src/lib/shopify/client.ts`)
- ✅ Complete implementation guides created in `/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDES/`

**What I Need:**
Implement new migration features following the detailed guides that have been created.

**Available Features to Implement:**
1. **Coupons/Discounts** (Priority: HIGH, Time: 2-3h) - `/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDES/01_COUPONS_GUIDE.md`
2. **Product Reviews** (Priority: MEDIUM, Time: 1-2h) - `/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDES/02_REVIEWS_GUIDE.md`
3. **Pages/Content** (Priority: MEDIUM, Time: 2-3h) - `/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDES/03_PAGES_GUIDE.md`
4. **Attributes & Tags** (Priority: LOW, Time: 3-5h) - `/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDES/04_ATTRIBUTES_TAGS_GUIDE.md`
5. **Shipping & Taxes** (Priority: LOW, Time: 3-5h) - `/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDES/05_SHIPPING_TAXES_GUIDE.md`

**Start Here:**
1. Read `/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDES/README.md` for overview
2. Read `/QUICK_START_NEW_FEATURES.md` for context
3. Then ask me which feature I want to implement first

**Important Notes:**
- All guides contain complete, copy-paste-ready code
- Each guide is self-contained with step-by-step instructions
- Infrastructure is already done - just need to implement the UI and transformers
- Follow the pattern established in existing features (Products, Customers, etc.)

**My Goal:**
[Choose one:]
- [ ] Implement just Coupons (MVP - 2-3 hours)
- [ ] Implement Coupons + Reviews (Quick wins - 4-6 hours)
- [ ] Implement all Phase 1 features (Coupons + Reviews + Pages - 5-8 hours)
- [ ] Implement everything (All features - 13-20 hours)

Please read the relevant guides and help me implement the features following the detailed instructions provided.

## 📝 Notes

- **Use the first version** if you want the AI to read the overview first
- **Use the second version** if you already know which feature you want and want to start immediately
- **Replace [FEATURE]** with the specific feature you want (Coupons, Reviews, Pages, etc.)
- **Check the box** for your goal in the first version

## 💡 Pro Tip

After pasting the prompt, the AI will likely ask you which feature to start with. Just say:

"Let's implement Coupons first. Please read `/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDES/01_COUPONS_GUIDE.md` and let's start with Step 1."

Then it will follow the guide step-by-step!
